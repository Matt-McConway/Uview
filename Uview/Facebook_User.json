However un recent times, i've found myself returning multiple times for a tasty and hearty roast meal. Prices are standard roast prices and you get the typical packed plastic package anyway, good kai for coin. This is just my opinion, feel free to attend and form your own. ",

But there are still things that aren't NYC pure - I had the Reuben - good portion size, nice tender meat but there was no bite to the sauerkraut nor the Russian dressing, it was a bit bland, the pickle was not an American doll however I can see they might want to use a local supply. The iceberg salad was ok, good sauce to lettuce combination, but iceberg wedges is what I expected. I'm not sure I would hurry back but can see the attraction ",
